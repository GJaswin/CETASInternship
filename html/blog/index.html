        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Frontend development involves creating the visual and interactive aspects of a website or application that
            users engage with directly. It combines design principles with coding to ensure a seamless user experience.
            Frontend developers use technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks and libraries
            such as React, Angular, or Vue.js, to build responsive and user-friendly interfaces. Their work bridges the
            gap between design and functionality, ensuring that applications are aesthetically pleasing, accessible, and
            performant across various devices and browsers.

    <section id="basics">
        <h2>Basics - HTML & CSS</h2>
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create the structure and content of a
            webpage. It organizes the layout of elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists by using
            a system of tags and attributes. HTML acts as the foundation of any webpage, ensuring that browsers can
            interpret and render the content for users. It is essential for defining the semantic structure, which
            improves accessibility and SEO.
        </p>
        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the appearance and layout of HTML
            elements on a webpage. It enables developers to apply colors, fonts, margins, padding, and animations,
            transforming the raw structure provided by HTML into visually appealing and user-friendly designs. CSS
            supports responsive design, ensuring that webpages adapt seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes,
            making it a critical tool for modern frontend development.

            <h2>Frameworks</h2>
            <p>
                Frameworks in frontend development are pre-written code libraries that provide a structured foundation
                for
                building user interfaces efficiently. They streamline development by offering reusable components,
                standardized practices, and tools for handling common tasks like DOM manipulation, state management, and
                routing. Frameworks such as Bootstrap, React and Angular help developers create responsive, dynamic, and
                scalable applications with less effort and more consistency. They also simplify collaboration by
                enforcing
                design patterns and reducing redundancy, enabling teams to focus on enhancing functionality and user
                experience.

            <article id="bootstrap">
                <h3>
                    Bootstrap
                </h3>
                <picture>
                    <source media="(min-width: 576px)" srcset="assets/bootstrap1.png">
                    <img src="assets/bootstrap2.png" alt="">
                </picture>
                <p>
                    Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative
                    web
                    pages (as opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to
                    apply
                    Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is
                    whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project,
                    Bootstrap
                    provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for
                    prose,
                    tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS
                    classes
                    defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap
                    has
                    provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text
                    with
                    a highlight.

                </h3>

                <p>
                    React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library
                    that aims to make building user interfaces based on components more "seamless". It is maintained by
                    Meta
                    (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.

                    React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks
                    like
                    Next.js and Remix. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components
                    to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side
                    functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only re-renders those parts of the page that
                    have changed, avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements.

            <article id="angular">
                <h3>
                    Angular
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Angular is a TypeScript-based free and open-source single-page web
                    application framework. It is developed by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations.
                    Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS. The Angular ecosystem
                    consists of
                    a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators. According to
                    the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, Angular is one of the most commonly used web frameworks.
                    Angular
                    uses a component-based architecture, which allows developers to build encapsulated, reusable user
                    interface elements. Each component encapsulates its own HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, making it easier
                    to
                    manage and test individual pieces of an application. Angular supports two-way data binding, which
                    synchronizes data between the model and the view. This ensures that any changes in the view are
                    automatically reflected in the model and vice versa.

                <h4>What are JavaScript based Frameworks?</h4>
                <p>
                    JavaScript-based frameworks are powerful tools for building dynamic and interactive web
                    applications.
                    They provide a structured approach to handle complex frontend functionalities like user interaction,
                    data binding, and application state management. Frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js enable
                    developers to create reusable components, manage data efficiently, and build single-page
                    applications
                    (SPAs) that offer seamless user experiences. These frameworks often come with built-in tools for
                    routing, performance optimization, and integration with backend services, making them ideal for
                    developing scalable and feature-rich applications. Their ability to handle real-time updates and
                    work
                    across various platforms has made them a cornerstone of modern web development.
